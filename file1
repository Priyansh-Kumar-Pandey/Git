hi this is the 1st commit from the aws , here we are trying to connect two people with same repo

hi this is the 1st commit from the local VM 



hi this is the second commit from the aws

hi this is the second commit from the local VM




here i'm tring to push using the ssh

ssh attempt failed 

ssh failed from local VM also

on 31/05/23
new trial for ssh the cloning was done without any problem and pushing the commit was aslo successful for me
now I'm trying the same thing for the aws server



well it 04/06/23 

i have also trie th git merge command and how to resolve the merge issue but i think while tring to go from one commit to another i may have been lost the previous commits coz i have checkout to an old commit an its been automatically upated to the GitHub  Sever but as i also prepare notes it not an problem for me to revise it
